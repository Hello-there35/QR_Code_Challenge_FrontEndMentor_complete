## My process
I add what I can and then do trial and error and maybe search online for new solutions
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties




### What I learned

I now have a basic understanding of how to use Flex display property and that using it is better than using normal css such as margin or padding for positioning.


```css
footer{
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
}

```




### Continued development

I don't quite understand flex from just this one project and I will be experimenting with it in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This helped me for get the google font Outfit
